Dummy classes with PHPDoc blocks for phpamqp extension.
Official PHP documentation was used to create these files.

Include in your project to use autocompletion functions in your favourite IDE.

Some classes have one method declared on the top class PHPDoc block, either it causes fatal errors :)
It is the `declare` method.
